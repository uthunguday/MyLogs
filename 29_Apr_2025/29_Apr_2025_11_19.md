### Relevant Files and Descriptions

#### **Code and Notebooks**
- **`mnist_reverse_nn.ipynb`**  
  A Jupyter Notebook that likely contains the main code for training and evaluating a neural network on the MNIST dataset. It may involve reversing or reconstructing digit images using neural networks.

- **`image.ipynb`**  
  Another Jupyter Notebook, possibly used for visualizing or generating images related to the MNIST dataset. It might include code for creating or analyzing digit images.

#### **Model and Data Files**
- **`mnist_model.npz`**  
  A saved model file in NumPy's `.npz` format. It likely contains the weights and biases of a trained neural network for the MNIST dataset.

- **`train-labels-idx1-ubyte.gz`, `train-images-idx3-ubyte.gz`, `t10k-labels-idx1-ubyte.gz`, `t10k-images-idx3-ubyte.gz`**  
  These are compressed files containing the MNIST dataset, including training and testing images and their corresponding labels.

- **`mnist.zip`**  
  A zipped version of the MNIST dataset, possibly downloaded for use in the project.

- **`kaggle.json`**  
  A configuration file for accessing Kaggle's API, likely used to download the MNIST dataset or related resources.

#### **Requirements**
- **`requirements.txt`**  
  A file listing the Python dependencies required to run the project. It likely includes libraries such as TensorFlow, PyTorch, NumPy, and Matplotlib.

#### **Diagrams and Visualizations**
- **`mnist_reverse_nn_full_block_diagram.png`**
