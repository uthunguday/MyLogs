- **`image.ipynb`**  
  Another Jupyter Notebook, possibly focused on generating or visualizing images, such as improved digit representations or comparisons.

#### **Model and Data Files**
- **`mnist_model.npz`**  
  A saved model file in NumPy's `.npz` format, likely containing weights and biases of the trained neural network.

- **`train-labels-idx1-ubyte.gz`, `train-images-idx3-ubyte.gz`, `t10k-labels-idx1-ubyte.gz`, `t10k-images-idx3-ubyte.gz`**  
  These are the MNIST dataset files, containing training and testing images and their corresponding labels.

- **`mnist.zip`**  
  A compressed file, likely containing the MNIST dataset or related resources.

- **`kaggle.json`**  
  A configuration file for accessing Kaggle's API, possibly used to download the MNIST dataset or related resources.

#### **Requirements**
- **`requirements.txt`**  
  A file listing the Python dependencies required to run the project, such as TensorFlow, PyTorch, NumPy, or Matplotlib.

#### **Diagrams and Visualizations**
- **`mnist_reverse_nn_full_block_diagram.png`**  
  A diagram illustrating the architecture or workflow of the reverse neural network used in the project.

- **`SimpleBlock.png`, `detailedBlock.png`**  
  Likely visual representations of specific blocks or components of the neural network.

- **`example7Graph.png`, `example7GenImage.png`**  
  Graphs or generated images related to digit "7," possibly showing model outputs or comparisons.

- **`digit_comparison_grid.png`, `digit_comparison_grid_large.png`, `all_digits_grid.png`**  
  Grids comparing original and generated digits or showcasing all digits generated by the model.

#### **Generated and Improved Images**
- **`improved_digit_0.png` to `improved_digit_9.png`**  
  Improved representations of digits (0-9), likely generated by the model after training or optimization.

- **`zero_grad_digit_7_512x512.png`, `output_512x512.png`, `MultipleGenImage.png`**  
  High-resolution images generated by the model, possibly showing outputs for digit "7" or multiple digits.
