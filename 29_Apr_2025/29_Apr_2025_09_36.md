### Project Description
This project appears to be focused on training and evaluating a neural network model on the MNIST dataset, which is a widely used dataset for handwritten digit recognition. The project likely involves training a model, visualizing its outputs, and improving its performance through iterative experimentation. The files suggest that this project is both educational (to learn skills in machine learning and neural networks) and practical (to build and evaluate a working model).

### Relevant Files and Their Descriptions

#### 1. `requirements.txt`
- **Purpose**: This file lists the Python dependencies required to run the project. It ensures that the correct libraries and versions are installed for the project to function properly.
- **Relevance**: Essential for setting up the project environment.

#### 2. `mnist_reverse_nn.ipynb`
- **Purpose**: A Jupyter Notebook that likely contains the main code for training, testing, and analyzing the neural network on the MNIST dataset. It may also include visualizations and explanations of the results.
- **Relevance**: Central to the project as it contains the implementation and experimentation.

#### 3. `mnist_model.npz`
- **Purpose**: A saved model file in NumPy's `.npz` format. It likely contains the weights and biases of the trained neural network.
- **Relevance**: Used to save and load the trained model for evaluation or further training.

#### 4. `train-labels-idx1-ubyte.gz`, `train-images-idx3-ubyte.gz`, `t10k-labels-idx1-ubyte.gz`, `t10k-images-idx3-ubyte.gz`
- **Purpose**: These are the compressed files containing the MNIST dataset. They include training and testing images and their corresponding labels.
- **Relevance**: Core dataset files required for training and testing the model.

#### 5. `mnist.zip`
- **Purpose**: A zipped version of the MNIST dataset, possibly downloaded from an external source.
- **Relevance**: Used to extract the dataset files for the project.

#### 6. `kaggle.json`
- **Purpose**: A configuration file containing API credentials for accessing Kaggle datasets. It might have been used to download the MNIST dataset.
- **Relevance**: Facilitates dataset acquisition.

#### 7. `improved_digit_0.png` to `improved_digit_9.png`
- **Purpose**: Images of digits (0-9) that have been improved or modified, possibly as part of the model's output or post-processing.
- **Relevance**: Used for visualizing the model's performance or improvements.

#### 8. `digit_comparison_grid.png`, `digit_comparison_grid_large.png`, `all_digits_grid.png`
- **Purpose**: Visualization grids comparing original and improved digits or showing all digits together. These are likely used to analyze and present the model's results.
- **Relevance**: Useful for evaluating and showcasing the model's performance.

#### 9. `output_512x512.png`, `zero_grad_digit_7_512x512.png`
- **Purpose**: Output images generated during the project, possibly visualizing gradients, activations, or model predictions.
- **Relevance**: Helps in understanding the model's behavior and debugging.

### Purpose of the Project
