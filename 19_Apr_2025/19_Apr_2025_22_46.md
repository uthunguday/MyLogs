## Generated On: Saturday, April 19, 2025 at 10:46:53 PM
This summary lists all files in the workspace with brief descriptions.

### Project Overview
The files listed suggest that the project is related to **resume screening using machine learning or natural language processing (NLP)**. The project likely involves analyzing resumes, generating predictions, and evaluating the fairness of the model. The use of files like `bert_embeddings.npy` and `tokenized_input_ids.npy` indicates the use of a transformer-based model like BERT for NLP tasks. The project seems to focus on both building a functional application and evaluating fairness in predictions, which could be part of a research or practical implementation.

The project appears to be **building a functional application** rather than just learning a new skill, as it includes an application script (`resume_app.py`), data files, and evaluation metrics.

### File Descriptions

#### 1. **tokenized_input_ids.npy**
- **Description**: A NumPy file containing tokenized input IDs for resumes, likely generated using a tokenizer (e.g., BERT tokenizer). These IDs are numerical representations of text data for model input.
- **Purpose**: Used as input for the NLP model.
- **Relevance**: Essential for preprocessing and model training.

#### 2. **tokenized_attention_masks.npy**
- **Description**: A NumPy file containing attention masks corresponding to the tokenized input IDs. Attention masks indicate which tokens should be attended to by the model.
- **Purpose**: Helps the model focus on relevant parts of the input.
- **Relevance**: Crucial for transformer-based models like BERT.

#### 3. **Resume_screening.ipynb**
- **Description**: A Jupyter Notebook likely used for exploratory data analysis (EDA), model training, or evaluation of the resume screening process.
- **Purpose**: Provides an interactive environment for testing and visualizing the model's performance.
- **Relevance**: Central to the development and experimentation phase of the project.

#### 4. **resume_app.py**
- **Description**: A Python script that likely serves as the main application for the resume screening system. It might include functionalities like loading the model, processing resumes, and generating predictions.
- **Purpose**: Implements the core functionality of the resume screening application.
- **Relevance**: Key file for deploying the project.

#### 5. **Resumes_data.csv**
- **Description**: A CSV file containing the dataset of resumes. It likely includes text data and possibly labels for training or evaluation.
- **Purpose**: Serves as the primary dataset for the project.
- **Relevance**: Fundamental for training and testing the model.

#### 6. **requirements.txt**
- **Description**: A text file listing the Python dependencies required for the project (e.g., TensorFlow, PyTorch, transformers, pandas).
- **Purpose**: Ensures that the project environment can be replicated.
- **Relevance**: Essential for setting up the project.

#### 7. **README.md**
- **Description**: A Markdown file providing an overview of the project, including its purpose, setup instructions, and usage details.
- **Purpose**: Helps users and contributors understand and use the project.
- **Relevance**: Important for documentation.

#### 8. **original_preds.npy**
- **Description**: A NumPy file containing the original predictions made by the model on the dataset.
- **Purpose**: Used for comparison and evaluation of model performance.
- **Relevance**: Useful for analyzing the model's behavior.

#### 9. **fairness_comparison.csv**
- **Description**: A CSV file containing metrics or results comparing the fairness of the model across different groups.
- **Purpose**: Evaluates the fairness of the model's predictions.
- **Relevance**: Important for ensuring ethical AI practices.

#### 10. **evaluation_comparison.csv**
- **Description**: A CSV file containing evaluation metrics (e.g., accuracy, precision, recall) for the model.
- **Purpose**: Assesses the performance of the model.
- **Relevance**: Crucial for understanding the model's effectiveness.

#### 11. **counterfactual_preds.npy**
- **Description**: A NumPy file containing predictions made on counterfactual data (modified data to test fairness).
- **Purpose**: Used to evaluate the model's robustness and fairness.
- **Relevance**: Important for fairness analysis.

#### 12. **counterfactual_fairness_result.txt**
- **Description**: A text file summarizing the results of the counterfactual fairness analysis.
- **Purpose**: Documents the fairness evaluation findings.
- **Relevance**: Useful for reporting and documentation.

#### 13. **bert_embeddings.npy**
- **Description**: A NumPy file containing BERT embeddings for the resumes. These embeddings are dense vector representations of the text data.
- **Purpose**: Used as input features for the model.
- **Relevance**: Essential for leveraging BERT in the project.
