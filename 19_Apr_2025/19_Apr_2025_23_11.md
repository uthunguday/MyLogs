### Project Overview
This project appears to be related to **fairness evaluation in machine learning models**, specifically in the context of **resume screening**. The files suggest that the project involves analyzing counterfactual fairness, evaluating model predictions, and working with natural language processing (NLP) techniques (e.g., BERT embeddings). The project likely aims to ensure that the resume screening process is unbiased and fair.

The files indicate that this is a **project-building effort**, not just for learning purposes, as it involves multiple components like data processing, fairness evaluation, and application development.

### File Descriptions

#### **counterfactual_preds.npy**
- **Description**: A NumPy file storing predictions made by the model on counterfactual data (data modified to test fairness).
- **Purpose**: Used to evaluate the fairness of the model by comparing predictions on original and counterfactual data.

#### **original_preds.npy**
- **Description**: A NumPy file containing the original predictions made by the model.
- **Purpose**: Serves as a baseline for comparison with counterfactual predictions.

#### **fairness_comparison.csv**
- **Description**: A CSV file summarizing fairness metrics or comparisons between original and counterfactual predictions.
- **Purpose**: Provides insights into how fair the model is in its decision-making.

#### **evaluation_comparison.csv**
- **Description**: A CSV file containing evaluation metrics (e.g., accuracy, precision, recall) for different models or configurations.
- **Purpose**: Helps compare the performance of various models or approaches.

#### **counterfactual_fairness_result.txt**
- **Description**: A text file summarizing the results of the counterfactual fairness analysis.
- **Purpose**: Documents the findings of the fairness evaluation for reporting purposes.

#### **bert_embeddings.npy**
- **Description**: A NumPy file containing BERT embeddings for resumes or related text data.
- **Purpose**: Used as input features for the machine learning model.

#### **tokenized_input_ids.npy**
- **Description**: A NumPy file storing tokenized input IDs for text data, likely generated using a tokenizer (e.g., BERT tokenizer).
- **Purpose**: Preprocessed input for the NLP model.

#### **tokenized_attention_masks.npy**
- **Description**: A NumPy file containing attention masks for tokenized text data.
- **Purpose**: Ensures the model focuses on relevant parts of the input during training or inference.

#### **Resume_screening.ipynb**
- **Description**: A Jupyter Notebook for developing and testing the resume screening model.
- **Purpose**: Likely used for exploratory data analysis, model training, and evaluation.

#### **resume_app.py**
- **Description**: A Python script for building a resume screening application.
- **Purpose**: Implements the functionality of the resume screening system, possibly including a user interface or API.

#### **Resumes_data.csv**
- **Description**: A CSV file containing resume data for training or testing the model.
- **Purpose**: Serves as the dataset for the project.

#### **requirements.txt**
- **Description**: A text file listing the Python dependencies required for the project.
- **Purpose**: Ensures that the project environment can be set up consistently.

#### **README.md**
- **Description**: A Markdown file providing an overview of the project.
- **Purpose**: Explains the project's purpose, setup instructions, and usage details.
