### Project Overview
This project appears to be focused on building and analyzing a machine learning model for processing resumes, potentially for hiring purposes. The project includes training a model, testing it for bias, and visualizing the results. It likely aims to address fairness in machine learning, particularly in hiring systems. The files suggest that this is a practical project, not just for learning but for building a functional system.

### File Descriptions

#### **README.md**
- **Purpose**: A documentation file that provides an overview of the project, its purpose, how to set it up, and how to use it. It is essential for anyone who wants to understand or contribute to the project.
- **Relevance**: Explains the project goals, setup instructions, and usage details.

#### **requirements.txt**
- **Purpose**: Lists all the Python dependencies required to run the project. It allows users to install the necessary libraries using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
- **Relevance**: Ensures that the environment is correctly set up for the project.

#### **main.py**
- **Purpose**: Likely the entry point of the project. It might orchestrate the workflow, such as loading data, training the model, testing for bias, and visualizing results.
- **Relevance**: Central to running the project.

#### **train_model.py**
- **Purpose**: Contains the code to train the machine learning model using the resume data. It might preprocess the data, define the model, and save the trained model.
- **Relevance**: Builds the core machine learning model.

#### **test_bias.py**
- **Purpose**: Tests the trained model for bias, likely by analyzing its predictions across different demographic groups.
- **Relevance**: Ensures fairness and ethical considerations in the model.

#### **visualize_bias.py**
- **Purpose**: Generates visualizations (e.g., charts or graphs) to illustrate the bias test results, such as the `selection_rate_by_group.png` file.
- **Relevance**: Helps interpret and communicate the bias analysis results.

#### **resume_model.joblib**
- **Purpose**: A serialized file containing the trained machine learning model. It can be loaded for predictions or further analysis.
- **Relevance**: Stores the trained model for reuse.

#### **resume_data.csv**
- **Purpose**: A dataset containing resume information, likely used for training and testing the model.
- **Relevance**: Provides the data foundation for the project.

#### **bias_test_results.csv**
- **Purpose**: A CSV file containing the results of the bias tests, possibly including metrics like selection rates or fairness scores.
- **Relevance**: Stores the output of the bias analysis for further review.

#### **selection_rate_by_group.png**
- **Purpose**: A visualization (likely generated by `visualize_bias.py`) showing the selection rates of different demographic groups.
- **Relevance**: Provides a graphical representation of bias in the model.
