### Project Overview
The files listed suggest this is a **machine learning project** focused on training a model (likely for resume screening or hiring decisions), testing for bias in the model, and visualizing the results. The project appears to aim at addressing fairness and bias in machine learning, particularly in hiring or selection processes. This project is likely being built to **develop a practical application** while also learning about bias detection and mitigation in machine learning.

### File Descriptions

#### **README.md**
- **Purpose**: A documentation file that provides an overview of the project, its purpose, how to set it up, and how to use it. It is essential for explaining the goals of the project and guiding users or collaborators.
- **Relevance**: This file is critical for understanding the project and its usage.

#### **requirements.txt**
- **Purpose**: Lists the Python dependencies and libraries required to run the project. It ensures that the environment can be set up consistently.
- **Relevance**: Essential for setting up the project environment.

#### **main.py**
- **Purpose**: Likely the entry point of the project. It could orchestrate the workflow, such as loading data, training the model, testing for bias, and visualizing results.
- **Relevance**: Central to running the project.

#### **train_model.py**
- **Purpose**: Contains the code to train the machine learning model, possibly using the data from `resume_data.csv`.
- **Relevance**: Focused on building the core model for the project.

#### **resume_model.joblib**
- **Purpose**: A serialized file containing the trained machine learning model. It can be loaded and used for predictions without retraining.
- **Relevance**: Represents the output of the training process.

#### **test_bias.py**
- **Purpose**: Contains code to test the trained model for bias, likely by analyzing its predictions across different demographic groups.
- **Relevance**: Focused on ensuring fairness and detecting bias in the model.

#### **bias_test_results.csv**
- **Purpose**: Stores the results of the bias testing, possibly including metrics like selection rates or fairness scores for different groups.
- **Relevance**: Provides insights into the fairness of the model.

#### **visualize_bias.py**
- **Purpose**: Contains code to generate visualizations (e.g., charts or graphs) to better understand the bias test results. It likely generates outputs like `selection_rate_by_group.png`.
- **Relevance**: Helps in interpreting and communicating the bias analysis.

#### **selection_rate_by_group.png**
- **Purpose**: A visualization (likely a chart or graph) showing the selection rates of the model across different demographic groups.
- **Relevance**: A visual representation of the model's fairness.

#### **resume_data.csv**
- **Purpose**: A dataset containing resume information, likely used to train the model. It may include features like education, experience, and demographic information.
- **Relevance**: The primary dataset for the project.
