### Project Overview
This project appears to focus on detecting and mitigating bias in AI models, specifically in the context of resume screening. The files suggest that the project involves training a machine learning model, testing it for bias, and visualizing the results. It likely aims to ensure fairness in AI-driven hiring processes. The project could be either a learning exercise or a real-world application, but the presence of detailed analysis and visualization files suggests it is more likely a project aimed at building a functional tool.

### File Descriptions

#### **Core Code Files**
- **`main.py`**  
  This is likely the main entry point of the project. It could orchestrate the workflow, such as loading data, training the model, testing for bias, and generating visualizations.

- **`train_model.py`**  
  This script is responsible for training the machine learning model using the provided dataset. It likely includes data preprocessing, model selection, and saving the trained model.

- **`test_bias.py`**  
  This script tests the trained model for bias. It might evaluate the model's performance across different demographic groups and calculate fairness metrics.

- **`visualize_bias.py`**  
  This script generates visualizations to help understand the bias in the model. It likely creates plots such as selection rates, probability distributions, and heatmaps.

#### **Data Files**
- **`training_dataset.csv`**  
  The dataset used to train the machine learning model. It likely contains features and labels for resumes.

- **`testing_dataset.csv`**  
  The dataset used to evaluate the model's performance and test for bias.

- **`resume_data.csv`**  
  A raw or preprocessed dataset containing resume information. It might be used for training or testing purposes.

- **`UpdatedResumeDataSet.csv`**  
  A newer or modified version of the resume dataset, possibly with additional features or corrections.

- **`full_dataset_info.csv`**  
  A file containing metadata or summary statistics about the entire dataset.

- **`bias_test_results.csv`**  
  A file containing the results of bias testing, such as fairness metrics or group-wise performance.

---

#### **Model and Logs**
- **`resume_model.joblib`**  
  The saved machine learning model, serialized using the `joblib` library. This allows the model to be reused without retraining.

- **`ai_resume_bias.log`**  
  A log file that likely contains runtime information, errors, or debugging messages related to the project.

---

#### **Visualization Files**
- **`selection_rate_by_group.png`**  
  A visualization showing the selection rate of resumes across different demographic groups.

- **`probability_heatmap.png`**  
  A heatmap visualization, possibly showing the probability distribution of predictions.

- **`probability_distribution_by_group.png`**  
  A plot showing the probability distribution of predictions for different demographic groups.

---

#### **Configuration and Documentation**
- **`requirements.txt`**  
  A file listing the Python dependencies required to run the project. It ensures that the environment can be set up consistently.

- **`README.md`**  
  A documentation file that explains the purpose of the project, how to set it up, and how to use it. It is essential for understanding the project's goals and usage.

### Purpose of the Project
This project is **building a functional tool** to detect and mitigate bias in AI models for resume screening. It is not just for learning purposes but aims to create a practical solution to address fairness in AI-driven hiring processes. 
### Project Description:
 ### Consolidated Summary:
The code implements a machine learning pipeline for analyzing resumes, training a logistic regression model, and testing for bias in predictions across demographic groups. It uses libraries like `scikit-learn`, `pandas`, and `seaborn` for data processing, model training, and visualization. The workflow includes dataset validation, model training, bias testing, and result visualization with bar plots, boxplots, and heatmaps. Extensive logging is used for tracking progress and errors.

### Consolidated Code Statistics:
- **Lines of Code:** 174
- **Number of Functions:** 4 (`validate_dataset`, `train_model`, `test_bias`, `visualize_results`)
- **Number of Classes:** 0
- **Imports:** 13 libraries/modules
- **Directories Created:** 2 (`models`, `results`)
- **Number of Visualizations:** 3 (bar plot, boxplot, heatmap)
- **Number of Logging Statements:** 10+
