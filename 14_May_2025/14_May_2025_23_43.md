### **Project Description**
This project appears to focus on detecting and mitigating bias in AI models used for resume screening. It likely involves training a machine learning model, testing it for bias, and visualizing the results. The project includes components for data preprocessing, model training, bias testing, and result visualization. This project is likely aimed at building a functional system rather than just learning new skills, as it involves multiple stages of development and analysis.

### **Conclusion**
This project is focused on building a functional system for detecting and mitigating bias in AI models for resume screening. It is not primarily aimed at learning new skills but rather at creating a practical and impactful solution. 
### Project Description:
 ### Consolidated Code Summary:
The code implements a machine learning pipeline for training a logistic regression model to classify resumes based on text content. It includes dataset validation, preprocessing, model training, bias testing, and result visualization. The workflow evaluates model performance across demographic groups, saves results in CSV format, and generates visualizations (bar plots, box plots, heatmaps). Extensive logging is used for tracking progress and debugging.

### Consolidated Code Statistics:
- **Total Lines of Code:** 174 (largest file)
- **Number of Functions:** 3 (`validate_dataset`, `train_model`, `test_bias`)
- **Number of Classes:** 0
- **Libraries Used:** 13 (e.g., `pandas`, `seaborn`, `matplotlib`, `logging`)
- **Directories Created:** 2 (`models`, `results`)
- **Purpose:** Resume classification and bias analysis with visualization.
