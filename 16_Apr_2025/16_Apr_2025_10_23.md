### File Descriptions

#### 1. **output_512x512.png**
   - **Description**: This is likely an output image generated during the project. Based on the name, it could be a visualization of results, such as a grid of handwritten digits or a heatmap related to the MNIST dataset.
   - **Purpose**: To display or visualize the results of the neural network's predictions or training process.

#### 2. **mnist_reverse_nn.ipynb**
   - **Description**: A Jupyter Notebook file that likely contains Python code, explanations, and visualizations for implementing a neural network on the MNIST dataset. The "reverse" in the name might indicate a specific variation or experiment, such as reversing the input digits or using a reverse propagation technique.
   - **Purpose**: To develop and test a neural network model for the MNIST dataset, possibly with a unique approach.

#### 3. **train-labels-idx1-ubyte.gz**
   - **Description**: A compressed file containing the labels for the training dataset of the MNIST handwritten digits. Each label corresponds to the digit (0-9) in the training images.
   - **Purpose**: Used as ground truth for training the neural network.

#### 4. **train-images-idx3-ubyte.gz**
   - **Description**: A compressed file containing the training images for the MNIST dataset. These are 28x28 grayscale images of handwritten digits.
   - **Purpose**: Used as input data for training the neural network.

#### 5. **t10k-labels-idx1-ubyte.gz**
   - **Description**: A compressed file containing the labels for the test dataset of the MNIST handwritten digits.
   - **Purpose**: Used as ground truth for evaluating the performance of the trained neural network.

#### 6. **t10k-images-idx3-ubyte.gz**
   - **Description**: A compressed file containing the test images for the MNIST dataset. These are 28x28 grayscale images of handwritten digits.
   - **Purpose**: Used as input data for testing the neural network.

#### 7. **mnist.zip**
   - **Description**: A compressed archive that likely contains the MNIST dataset files (e.g., training and testing images and labels).
   - **Purpose**: To provide the dataset in a single downloadable package.

### Project Description

- **Project Name**: MNIST Neural Network Experiment
- **Purpose**: This project involves building and experimenting with a neural network to classify handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset. The "reverse" in the notebook name suggests that the project might include a unique variation or experiment, such as reversing the input digits or exploring alternative neural network architectures.
- **Learning or Building**: This project is primarily focused on **learning**. It is designed to help the user understand neural networks, dataset handling, and machine learning workflows using the MNIST dataset, which is a common starting point for beginners in deep learning.

### Summary
The files are part of a learning project aimed at understanding and experimenting with neural networks using the MNIST dataset. The project includes dataset files, a Jupyter Notebook for implementation, and an output image for visualization. 
### Project Description:
 ### Consolidated Summary:
The code is a Python implementation for downloading, processing, and training on the MNIST dataset using a custom neural network. It includes functionalities for data preprocessing, defining activation and loss functions, forward and backward propagation, and training the network. The `NeuralNetwork` class supports a 3-layer architecture (input, two hidden layers, and output) with gradient descent optimization. The code also visualizes MNIST images, solves linear equations using least squares, and generates images based on target probabilities. Additional tasks include resizing and verifying images using a neural network.

### Consolidated Code Statistics:
- **Lines of Code**: ~227
- **Number of Functions**: 10 (e.g., `update_params`, `predict`, `train`, `generate_image_from_probs`)
- **Number of Classes**: 1 (`NeuralNetwork`)
- **Libraries Used**: 9 (e.g., `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `Pillow`, `os`)
- **Layers in Neural Network**: 4 (Input, Hidden1, Hidden2, Output)
- **Hyperparameters**: 3 (Epochs, Learning Rate, Batch Size)
- **Visualizations**: 2 (MNIST image, 3D plot of linear equations)
