### File Descriptions

#### 1. **output_512x512.png**
   - **Description**: This is likely an output image file generated by the project. Based on the name, it could be a visualization of results, such as predictions or reconstructions from a neural network trained on the MNIST dataset.
   - **Purpose**: To display or save the results of the model's performance or output.
   - **Relevance**: Related to the project as it provides visual feedback on the model's performance.

#### 2. **mnist_reverse_nn.ipynb**
   - **Description**: A Jupyter Notebook file that likely contains Python code for implementing and experimenting with a neural network (NN) on the MNIST dataset. The term "reverse" might indicate a specific approach, such as reversing the input-output mapping or experimenting with adversarial techniques.
   - **Purpose**: To develop, train, and evaluate a neural network model on the MNIST dataset.
   - **Relevance**: Core file for the project as it contains the main implementation and experimentation.

#### 3. **train-labels-idx1-ubyte.gz**
   - **Description**: A compressed file containing the labels for the training dataset of MNIST. These labels are used to train the neural network by providing the correct output for each input image.
   - **Purpose**: To provide ground truth labels for training the model.
   - **Relevance**: Essential for training the neural network.

#### 4. **train-images-idx3-ubyte.gz**
   - **Description**: A compressed file containing the training images of the MNIST dataset. These are grayscale images of handwritten digits (0-9).
   - **Purpose**: To serve as the input data for training the neural network.
   - **Relevance**: Essential for training the neural network.

#### 5. **t10k-labels-idx1-ubyte.gz**
   - **Description**: A compressed file containing the labels for the test dataset of MNIST. These labels are used to evaluate the model's performance on unseen data.
   - **Purpose**: To provide ground truth labels for testing the model.
   - **Relevance**: Essential for evaluating the neural network.

#### 6. **t10k-images-idx3-ubyte.gz**
   - **Description**: A compressed file containing the test images of the MNIST dataset. These are used to evaluate the model's performance on unseen data.
   - **Purpose**: To serve as the input data for testing the neural network.
   - **Relevance**: Essential for evaluating the neural network.

#### 7. **mnist.zip**
   - **Description**: A compressed archive that likely contains the MNIST dataset files (e.g., training and testing images and labels).
   - **Purpose**: To bundle and distribute the MNIST dataset.
   - **Relevance**: Provides the dataset required for the project.
