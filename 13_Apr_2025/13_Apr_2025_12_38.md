### File Descriptions

#### 1. **output_512x512.png**
   - **Description**: This file is likely an output image generated during the project. Based on the name, it could be a visualization of results, such as a heatmap, confusion matrix, or reconstructed image from a neural network.
   - **Purpose**: To visually represent the results of the neural network's performance or output.
   - **Relevance**: Likely used to analyze or demonstrate the results of the project.

#### 2. **mnist_reverse_nn.ipynb**
   - **Description**: A Jupyter Notebook file that likely contains Python code, explanations, and visualizations for implementing a neural network on the MNIST dataset. The "reverse" in the name might indicate a specific variation or experiment, such as reversing the input images or labels.
   - **Purpose**: To develop, train, and evaluate a neural network model on the MNIST dataset.
   - **Relevance**: Central to the project as it contains the main implementation and experimentation.

#### 3. **train-labels-idx1-ubyte.gz**
   - **Description**: A compressed file containing the labels for the training dataset of MNIST. Each label corresponds to a digit (0-9) for the training images.
   - **Purpose**: Used as ground truth for training the neural network.
   - **Relevance**: Essential for training the model.

#### 4. **train-images-idx3-ubyte.gz**
   - **Description**: A compressed file containing the training images of the MNIST dataset. Each image is a 28x28 grayscale representation of a handwritten digit.
   - **Purpose**: Provides the input data for training the neural network.
   - **Relevance**: Essential for training the model.

#### 5. **t10k-labels-idx1-ubyte.gz**
   - **Description**: A compressed file containing the labels for the test dataset of MNIST. Each label corresponds to a digit (0-9) for the test images.
   - **Purpose**: Used as ground truth for evaluating the neural network's performance.
   - **Relevance**: Essential for testing the model.

#### 6. **t10k-images-idx3-ubyte.gz**
   - **Description**: A compressed file containing the test images of the MNIST dataset. Each image is a 28x28 grayscale representation of a handwritten digit.
   - **Purpose**: Provides the input data for testing the neural network.
   - **Relevance**: Essential for testing the model.

#### 7. **mnist.zip**
   - **Description**: A compressed archive that likely contains the MNIST dataset files (e.g., training and testing images and labels).
   - **Purpose**: To package and distribute the MNIST dataset.
   - **Relevance**: Used to provide the dataset for the project.
