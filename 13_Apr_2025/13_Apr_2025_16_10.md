### File Descriptions

#### 1. **output_512x512.png**
   - **Description**: This file is likely an output image generated during the project. Based on the name, it could be a visualization of results, such as a heatmap, digit classification, or reconstructed image from a neural network.
   - **Purpose**: To display the results of the model's predictions or visualizations.
   - **Relevance**: It is part of the project and helps in understanding the model's performance.

#### 2. **mnist_reverse_nn.ipynb**
   - **Description**: This is a Jupyter Notebook file. Based on the name, it likely contains code and explanations for implementing a neural network (NN) on the MNIST dataset, possibly with a unique approach like reversing the input or output.
   - **Purpose**: To develop and test a machine learning model using the MNIST dataset.
   - **Relevance**: This is the main file where the project logic and experiments are implemented.

#### 3. **train-labels-idx1-ubyte.gz**
   - **Description**: This is a compressed file containing the labels for the training dataset of MNIST. Each label corresponds to a digit (0-9).
   - **Purpose**: Used as ground truth for training the neural network.
   - **Relevance**: Essential for training the model.

#### 4. **train-images-idx3-ubyte.gz**
   - **Description**: This is a compressed file containing the training images of the MNIST dataset. Each image is a 28x28 grayscale image of a handwritten digit.
   - **Purpose**: Used as input data for training the neural network.
   - **Relevance**: Essential for training the model.

#### 5. **t10k-labels-idx1-ubyte.gz**
   - **Description**: This is a compressed file containing the labels for the test dataset of MNIST. Each label corresponds to a digit (0-9).
   - **Purpose**: Used as ground truth for evaluating the model's performance.
   - **Relevance**: Essential for testing the model.

#### 6. **t10k-images-idx3-ubyte.gz**
   - **Description**: This is a compressed file containing the test images of the MNIST dataset. Each image is a 28x28 grayscale image of a handwritten digit.
   - **Purpose**: Used as input data for testing the neural network.
   - **Relevance**: Essential for testing the model.

#### 7. **mnist.zip**
   - **Description**: This is a compressed archive that likely contains the MNIST dataset files (e.g., training and testing images and labels).
   - **Purpose**: To provide the dataset in a single downloadable package.
   - **Relevance**: Used to set up the project.
