### Project Description:
 ### Consolidated Summary:
The code is a Python implementation of a neural network for processing and classifying MNIST data. It includes data preprocessing, neural network training with forward and backward propagation, and visualization of MNIST images. The network architecture consists of an input layer, two hidden layers, and an output layer, using activation functions like Sigmoid and Softmax. It also demonstrates solving linear equations using least squares and generating input images for the neural network. The code handles image resizing, visualization, and verification tasks with error handling for missing libraries.

### Consolidated Code Statistics:
- **Total Lines of Code:** ~223
- **Number of Functions:** 10 (e.g., `forward`, `backward`, `train`, `accuracy`, `generate_image_from_probs`)
- **Number of Classes:** 1 (`NeuralNetwork`)
- **Number of Layers:** 4 (Input, 2 Hidden, Output)
- **Libraries Used:** 9 (e.g., `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `Pillow`, `pandas`)
- **Training Hyperparameters:** Epochs (15), Learning Rate (0.1), Batch Size (64)
- **Purpose:** MNIST classification, neural network training, image processing, and visualization.
