# Uthung uday's Workspace File Summary
## Generated On: Monday, April 21, 2025 at 8:43:13 AM
This summary lists all files in the workspace with brief descriptions.
---
### Project Overview
The files listed appear to belong to a **machine learning fairness library** project, likely **Fairlearn** or a similar framework. This project focuses on providing tools to assess and mitigate bias in machine learning models. It includes utilities for fairness metrics, bias mitigation techniques, and visualization tools. The project is both a learning resource and a production-ready library for developers and researchers working on fairness in AI.

The files suggest the project is a mix of **learning new skills** (e.g., tutorials, examples) and **building a production-ready library** (e.g., core functionality, tests, and documentation).

### Purpose of the Files
- **Learning New Skills**: Files like `plot_*.py`, `quickstart.rst`, and `ways_to_contribute.rst` are designed to help users learn how to use the library and understand fairness concepts.
- **Building a Project**: Core files like `train_model.py`, `adversarial_fairness.py`, and `grid_search.py` are part of the production-ready library, while test files ensure robustness and reliability.
