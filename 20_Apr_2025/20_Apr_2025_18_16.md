# Uthung uday's Workspace File Summary
## Generated On: Sunday, April 20, 2025 at 6:16:15 PM
This summary lists all files in the workspace with brief descriptions.

### Project Overview
This project appears to be related to **automated resume screening** using machine learning or natural language processing (NLP). The files suggest that the project involves tokenizing resumes, generating embeddings (likely using BERT), and evaluating the fairness of the model's predictions. It may also include a web application for interacting with the resume screening system.

The project seems to be **building a functional application** rather than just learning a new skill, as it includes a mix of data processing, model evaluation, and application development.

### File Descriptions

#### **Resumes_data.csv**
- **Description**: A CSV file containing raw resume data, likely used as input for training or testing the resume screening model.
- **Purpose**: Provides the dataset for the project.

#### **tokenized_input_ids.npy**
- **Description**: A NumPy file containing tokenized input IDs for resumes, likely generated using a tokenizer (e.g., BERT tokenizer).
- **Purpose**: Used as input for the NLP model.

#### **tokenized_attention_masks.npy**
- **Description**: A NumPy file containing attention masks corresponding to the tokenized input IDs.
- **Purpose**: Helps the NLP model focus on relevant parts of the input.

#### **Resume_screening.ipynb**
- **Description**: A Jupyter Notebook for developing and testing the resume screening model.
- **Purpose**: Likely used for experimentation, training, and evaluation of the model.

#### **resume_app.py**
- **Description**: A Python script for the web application that allows users to interact with the resume screening system.
- **Purpose**: Implements the front-end or back-end logic for the application.

#### **requirements.txt**
- **Description**: A text file listing the Python dependencies required for the project.
- **Purpose**: Ensures that the project environment can be set up consistently.

#### **README.md**
- **Description**: A markdown file providing an overview of the project, instructions for setup, and usage details.
- **Purpose**: Serves as documentation for the project.

#### **original_preds.npy**
- **Description**: A NumPy file containing the original predictions made by the model.
- **Purpose**: Used for comparison during evaluation or fairness analysis.

#### **fairness_comparison.csv**
- **Description**: A CSV file containing data for comparing the fairness of the model's predictions.
- **Purpose**: Helps analyze and improve the fairness of the model.

#### **evaluation_comparison.csv**
- **Description**: A CSV file containing evaluation metrics for comparing different models or configurations.
- **Purpose**: Used to assess the performance of the model.

#### **counterfactual_preds.npy**
- **Description**: A NumPy file containing predictions made on counterfactual data (e.g., modified resumes).
- **Purpose**: Used to evaluate counterfactual fairness.

#### **counterfactual_fairness_result.txt**
- **Description**: A text file summarizing the results of the counterfactual fairness analysis.
- **Purpose**: Documents the fairness evaluation findings.

#### **bert_embeddings.npy**
- **Description**: A NumPy file containing BERT embeddings generated from the resume data.
- **Purpose**: Used as input features for the model.
