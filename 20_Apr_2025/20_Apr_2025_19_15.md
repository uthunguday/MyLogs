### Project Overview
The files listed appear to belong to **Fairlearn**, an open-source Python library designed to assess and mitigate fairness-related issues in machine learning models. The project focuses on providing tools to evaluate fairness metrics, mitigate bias, and ensure equitable outcomes in machine learning workflows. It is a mature project aimed at building practical tools for fairness in AI, rather than a learning exercise.

### Purpose
This project is **building a library** for fairness in machine learning. It is not a learning exercise but a professional-grade tool aimed at addressing real-world challenges in AI fairness. 
### Project Description:
 ### Code Summary:
The Python script trains a text classification model using a TF-IDF vectorizer and Logistic Regression. It processes text data from a CSV file, splits it into training and testing sets, trains the model, and saves it for future use.

### Code Statistics:
- **Lines of Code**: 33
- **Number of Functions**: 1 (`train_model`)
- **Number of Classes**: 0
- **External Libraries Used**: `pandas`, `joblib`, `sklearn`
- **Purpose**: Train and save a text classification model.
