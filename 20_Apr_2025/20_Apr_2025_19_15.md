### Project Overview
This project appears to be related to **AI-driven Resume Screening** with a focus on **counterfactual fairness**. The goal is likely to build a machine learning model (possibly using BERT embeddings) to evaluate resumes while ensuring fairness in predictions. The project includes data preprocessing, model evaluation, and fairness analysis.
