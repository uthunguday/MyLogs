# Uthung uday's Workspace File Summary
## Generated On: Sunday, April 20, 2025 at 5:01:15 PM
This summary lists all files in the workspace with brief descriptions.
---
### Project Overview
The files listed suggest that the project is related to **resume screening using machine learning or natural language processing (NLP)**. The project likely involves analyzing resumes, generating predictions, and evaluating fairness in the screening process. The use of files like `bert_embeddings.npy` and `tokenized_input_ids.npy` indicates the use of a transformer-based model like BERT for NLP tasks. The project appears to focus on **building a functional application** rather than just learning a new skill, as it includes both implementation and evaluation components.

### File Descriptions

#### 1. **tokenized_input_ids.npy**
   - **Description**: A NumPy file containing tokenized input IDs for resumes, likely generated using a tokenizer (e.g., BERT tokenizer). These IDs are numerical representations of text data used for model input.
   - **Purpose**: Preprocessed data for feeding into a machine learning model.
   - **Relevance**: Core to the NLP pipeline for resume screening.

#### 2. **tokenized_attention_masks.npy**
   - **Description**: A NumPy file containing attention masks corresponding to the tokenized input IDs. Attention masks indicate which tokens should be attended to by the model.
   - **Purpose**: Ensures the model focuses on relevant parts of the input during training or inference.
   - **Relevance**: Essential for transformer-based models like BERT.

#### 3. **Resume_screening.ipynb**
   - **Description**: A Jupyter Notebook likely containing the main implementation of the resume screening process. It may include data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and visualization.
   - **Purpose**: Interactive development and experimentation for the resume screening pipeline.
   - **Relevance**: Central to the project.

#### 4. **resume_app.py**
   - **Description**: A Python script that likely serves as the backend or main application logic for the resume screening system.
   - **Purpose**: Implements the functionality for screening resumes, possibly including a user interface or API.
   - **Relevance**: Core to the deployment or operational aspect of the project.

#### 5. **Resumes_data.csv**
   - **Description**: A CSV file containing resume data, possibly including text and labels for training or evaluation.
   - **Purpose**: Serves as the dataset for the project.
   - **Relevance**: Fundamental for training and testing the model.

#### 6. **requirements.txt**
   - **Description**: A text file listing the Python dependencies required for the project.
   - **Purpose**: Ensures reproducibility by specifying the libraries and their versions.
   - **Relevance**: Necessary for setting up the project environment.

#### 7. **README.md**
   - **Description**: A markdown file providing an overview of the project, including its purpose, setup instructions, and usage.
   - **Purpose**: Helps users and collaborators understand and use the project.
   - **Relevance**: Essential for documentation.

#### 8. **original_preds.npy**
   - **Description**: A NumPy file containing the original predictions made by the model on the dataset.
   - **Purpose**: Used for evaluation or comparison with other predictions.
   - **Relevance**: Important for analyzing model performance.

#### 9. **fairness_comparison.csv**
   - **Description**: A CSV file containing data for comparing fairness metrics across different models or scenarios.
   - **Purpose**: Evaluates the fairness of the resume screening process.
   - **Relevance**: Highlights ethical considerations in the project.

#### 10. **evaluation_comparison.csv**
   - **Description**: A CSV file containing evaluation metrics (e.g., accuracy, precision, recall) for comparing different models or configurations.
   - **Purpose**: Assesses the performance of the resume screening system.
   - **Relevance**: Critical for model selection and improvement.

#### 11. **counterfactual_preds.npy**
   - **Description**: A NumPy file containing predictions made under counterfactual scenarios (e.g., modified input data to test fairness).
   - **Purpose**: Tests the robustness and fairness of the model.
   - **Relevance**: Important for fairness evaluation.

#### 12. **counterfactual_fairness_result.txt**
   - **Description**: A text file summarizing the results of counterfactual fairness analysis.
   - **Purpose**: Documents the fairness evaluation findings.
   - **Relevance**: Provides insights into the ethical implications of the model.

#### 13. **bert_embeddings.npy**
   - **Description**: A NumPy file containing BERT embeddings for the resumes. These embeddings are dense vector representations of the text data.
   - **Purpose**: Used as input features for the machine learning model.
   - **Relevance**: Core to the NLP pipeline.

### Purpose of the Project
This project is **building a functional application** for resume screening using NLP techniques. It also emphasizes **fairness evaluation**, ensuring the model does not exhibit bias in its predictions. The inclusion of fairness-related files suggests a focus on ethical AI practices. 
### Project Description:
 ### Consolidated Summary:
The code implements an AI-powered resume screening system using Streamlit. It processes resumes (PDF/DOCX), extracts text, and predicts candidate suitability for specific roles using a custom BERT-based adversarial model. It integrates SHAP for explainability and provides feedback on missing skills based on job roles. A smaller snippet handles user feedback, warning users if a job description is missing or providing acceptance/rejection messages.

### Code Statistics:
- **Total Lines of Code**: 146 (138 + 8)
- **Number of Functions**: 7
- **Number of Classes**: 2
- **Conditional Statements**: 3
- **Imported Libraries**: 10
- **Key Features**: Resume text extraction, role mapping, suitability prediction, feedback generation, SHAP integration.
