# Uthung uday's Workspace File Summary
## Generated On: Saturday, May 10, 2025 at 12:06:12 PM
This summary lists all files in the workspace with brief descriptions.
---
### Project Overview
The files listed suggest that the project is related to **automated resume screening** using machine learning or natural language processing (NLP). The presence of files like `bert_embeddings.npy`, `Resume_screening.ipynb`, and `resume_app.py` indicates that the project involves analyzing resumes, possibly using a BERT-based model for NLP tasks. Additionally, files like `fairness_comparison.csv` and `counterfactual_fairness_result.txt` suggest that the project also evaluates fairness and bias in the screening process.

This project appears to be **building a functional application** rather than just learning a new skill, as it includes both implementation files (`resume_app.py`) and evaluation files for fairness and bias.

### File Descriptions

#### 1. **original_preds.npy**
   - **Description**: A NumPy file containing the original predictions made by the model. Likely used for comparison with counterfactual predictions to evaluate fairness or bias.
   - **Purpose**: To store model outputs for further analysis.

#### 2. **requirements.txt**
   - **Description**: A text file listing all the Python dependencies required to run the project.
   - **Purpose**: Ensures that the project environment can be replicated by installing the necessary libraries using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

#### 3. **README.md**
   - **Description**: A markdown file providing an overview of the project, instructions for setup, usage, and any additional details.
   - **Purpose**: Acts as documentation for the project, helping others understand and use the code.

#### 4. **fairness_comparison.csv**
   - **Description**: A CSV file containing data comparing fairness metrics across different models or scenarios.
   - **Purpose**: Used to evaluate and document the fairness of the resume screening model.

#### 5. **evaluation_comparison.csv**
   - **Description**: A CSV file containing evaluation metrics (e.g., accuracy, precision, recall) for the model.
   - **Purpose**: To compare the performance of different models or configurations.

#### 6. **counterfactual_preds.npy**
   - **Description**: A NumPy file containing predictions made under counterfactual scenarios (e.g., changing sensitive attributes like gender or race).
   - **Purpose**: Used to assess the model's fairness by analyzing how predictions change under counterfactual conditions.

#### 7. **counterfactual_fairness_result.txt**
   - **Description**: A text file summarizing the results of counterfactual fairness analysis.
   - **Purpose**: Documents the findings related to fairness and bias in the model.

#### 8. **bert_embeddings.npy**
   - **Description**: A NumPy file containing BERT embeddings for resumes. These embeddings are vector representations of text data.
   - **Purpose**: Used as input features for the machine learning model.

#### 9. **Resumes_data.csv**
   - **Description**: A CSV file containing raw or preprocessed resume data.
   - **Purpose**: Serves as the primary dataset for training or evaluating the model.

#### 10. **tokenized_input_ids.npy**
   - **Description**: A NumPy file containing tokenized input IDs for resumes, generated using a tokenizer (likely BERT).
   - **Purpose**: Used as input to the NLP model.

#### 11. **tokenized_attention_masks.npy**
   - **Description**: A NumPy file containing attention masks corresponding to the tokenized input IDs.
   - **Purpose**: Helps the model focus on relevant parts of the input during training or inference.

#### 12. **Resume_screening.ipynb**
   - **Description**: A Jupyter Notebook containing code for training, evaluating, or analyzing the resume screening model.
   - **Purpose**: Likely used for experimentation and visualization during development.

#### 13. **resume_app.py**
   - **Description**: A Python script for the main application, possibly implementing a web or command-line interface for the resume screening system.
   - **Purpose**: Provides a functional interface for users to interact with the model.

### Project Purpose
This project is focused on **building a functional application** for automated resume screening while ensuring fairness and mitigating bias. It involves:
- **NLP techniques** (e.g., BERT embeddings, tokenization).
- **Fairness evaluation** (e.g., counterfactual analysis, fairness metrics).
- **Application development** (e.g., `resume_app.py`).

The project is likely aimed at creating a practical tool for resume screening while addressing ethical concerns like bias and fairness.
