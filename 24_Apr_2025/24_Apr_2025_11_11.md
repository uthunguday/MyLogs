### Project Overview
The files listed suggest that the project is related to **Resume Screening using Natural Language Processing (NLP)**. The project likely involves automating the process of evaluating resumes using machine learning models, specifically leveraging BERT embeddings for text analysis. Additionally, there seems to be a focus on **fairness evaluation** in the model's predictions, which indicates an effort to ensure unbiased decision-making.

This project appears to be **building a functional application** rather than just learning a new skill, as it includes application code (`resume_app.py`), data files, and fairness evaluation metrics.

### File Descriptions

#### 1. **tokenized_input_ids.npy**
   - **Description**: A NumPy file containing tokenized input IDs for resumes, likely generated using a tokenizer (e.g., BERT tokenizer). These IDs represent the numerical encoding of the text data.
   - **Purpose**: Used as input for the NLP model during training or inference.

#### 2. **tokenized_attention_masks.npy**
   - **Description**: A NumPy file containing attention masks corresponding to the tokenized input IDs. Attention masks indicate which tokens should be attended to by the model.
   - **Purpose**: Helps the NLP model focus on relevant parts of the input during processing.

#### 3. **Resume_screening.ipynb**
   - **Description**: A Jupyter Notebook containing code for training, evaluating, or analyzing the resume screening model.
   - **Purpose**: Likely used for experimentation, visualization of results, and debugging during development.

#### 4. **resume_app.py**
   - **Description**: A Python script that serves as the main application for the resume screening system.
   - **Purpose**: Implements the functionality to process resumes, make predictions, and possibly provide a user interface or API for the application.

#### 5. **Resumes_data.csv**
   - **Description**: A CSV file containing the dataset of resumes. It likely includes text data and possibly labels for training or evaluation.
   - **Purpose**: Serves as the primary dataset for the project.

#### 6. **requirements.txt**
   - **Description**: A text file listing the Python dependencies required for the project.
   - **Purpose**: Ensures that all necessary libraries (e.g., NumPy, Transformers, etc.) are installed for the project to run.

#### 7. **README.md**
   - **Description**: A Markdown file providing an overview of the project, including its purpose, setup instructions, and usage details.
   - **Purpose**: Helps users and contributors understand the project and how to use it.

#### 8. **original_preds.npy**
   - **Description**: A NumPy file containing the original predictions made by the model on the dataset.
   - **Purpose**: Used for comparison during fairness evaluation or debugging.

#### 9. **fairness_comparison.csv**
   - **Description**: A CSV file containing metrics or results comparing the fairness of the model's predictions.
   - **Purpose**: Evaluates whether the model's predictions are unbiased across different groups.

#### 10. **evaluation_comparison.csv**
   - **Description**: A CSV file containing evaluation metrics (e.g., accuracy, precision, recall) for the model.
   - **Purpose**: Used to assess the performance of the model.

#### 11. **counterfactual_preds.npy**
   - **Description**: A NumPy file containing predictions made by the model on counterfactual data (data modified to test fairness).
   - **Purpose**: Helps evaluate the model's robustness and fairness.

#### 12. **counterfactual_fairness_result.txt**
   - **Description**: A text file summarizing the results of the counterfactual fairness evaluation.
   - **Purpose**: Documents whether the model meets fairness criteria.

#### 13. **bert_embeddings.npy**
   - **Description**: A NumPy file containing BERT embeddings for the resumes in the dataset.
   - **Purpose**: Represents the resumes in a high-dimensional vector space for use in the model.

### Summary
This project is a **functional application** aimed at automating resume screening using NLP techniques, with a strong emphasis on fairness and unbiased decision-making. The files indicate a mix of data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and application development. 
### Project Description:
 ### Consolidated Summary:
The code implements an AI-powered resume screening system using Streamlit. It processes resumes (PDF/DOCX), extracts text, and predicts candidate suitability for a role using a pre-trained adversarial BERT model. It provides feedback on missing skills based on predefined role-specific keywords and includes a Streamlit UI for interaction. A snippet of the code handles feedback generation, listing missing skills or providing acceptance/rejection messages.

### Code Statistics:
- **Total Lines of Code:** 152  
- **Number of Functions:** 7  
- **Number of Classes:** 2  
- **Imported Libraries:** 10  
- **Streamlit UI Components:** 5  
- **Number of Conditional Statements (Snippet):** 3  
- **Number of Variables (Snippet):** 2 (`feedback`, `missing_skills`)
