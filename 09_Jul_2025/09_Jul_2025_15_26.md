### Project Purpose
This project is **building a sentiment analysis application** using machine learning techniques. It involves preprocessing data, training a model, and deploying the application with Streamlit for user interaction. The project is likely aimed at solving a real-world problem or demonstrating practical skills in machine learning and application development. 
### Project Description:
 ### Code Summary:
The script trains a Gradient Boosting Regressor model using `scikit-learn`. It splits data into training and testing sets, performs hyperparameter tuning via Grid Search, and evaluates the model using MSE and RÂ² score. The best model and evaluation metrics are returned.

### Statistics:
- **Lines of Code:** 20  
- **Number of Functions:** 1 (`train_model`)  
- **Number of Classes:** 0  
- **Imports:** 3 (`train_test_split`, `GridSearchCV`, `mean_squared_error`)  
- **External Libraries Used:** `scikit-learn`
