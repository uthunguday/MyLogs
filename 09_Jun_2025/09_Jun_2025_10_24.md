## Generated On: Monday, June 9, 2025 at 10:24:34 AM
This summary lists all files in the workspace with brief descriptions.
---
### Project Overview
The files listed suggest a **web application project** built using **React** (indicated by `.tsx` files), **TypeScript**, and **Tailwind CSS** for styling. The presence of `vite.config.ts` indicates the use of **Vite** as the build tool. The project appears to focus on **data visualization** and **UI component development**, with files like `VisualizationCard.tsx`, `DataVisualizations.tsx`, and various placeholder visualization files (`placeholder_heatmap.html`, etc.). The project may also include reusable UI components (`button.tsx`, `accordion.tsx`, etc.) and utilities for handling data (`dataUtils.ts`, `utils.ts`).

This project seems to be **building a product or tool** rather than solely learning new skills, as it includes structured configurations, reusable components, and visualization features.
