### Project Overview

This project appears to be focused on **AI-based resume analysis and bias detection**. The files suggest that the project involves training a machine learning model to analyze resumes, detect biases, and visualize the results. The project likely includes data preprocessing, model training, testing, and visualization of bias-related metrics.

### File Descriptions

#### Common Files
- **README.md**:  
  A documentation file that provides an overview of the project, its purpose, setup instructions, and usage guidelines. This file is essential for understanding the project and is typically the first file a user reads.

- **requirements.txt**:  
  A file listing the Python dependencies required to run the project. It ensures that the correct libraries are installed for the project to function properly.

#### Source Code Files
- **main.py**:  
  Likely the main entry point of the project. This script might orchestrate the workflow, such as loading data, training the model, testing for bias, and visualizing results.

- **visualize_bias.py**:  
  A script dedicated to generating visualizations (e.g., heatmaps, bar charts) to represent bias metrics in the resume analysis.

- **train_model.py**:  
  A script for training the machine learning model using the provided training dataset. It likely preprocesses the data and saves the trained model for later use.

- **test_bias.py**:  
  A script for testing the trained model on datasets to detect biases and log the results. It might also generate metrics for visualization.

#### Data Files
- **training_dataset.csv**:  
  Contains the data used to train the machine learning model. Likely includes labeled resumes with features relevant to bias detection.

- **testing_dataset.csv**:  
  Contains the data used to test the trained model and evaluate its performance.

- **resume_data.csv**:  
  Raw or preprocessed resume data used in the project.

- **UpdatedResumeDataSet.csv**:  
  An updated version of the resume dataset, possibly cleaned or augmented for better model performance.

- **full_dataset_info.csv**:  
  Likely contains metadata or descriptive statistics about the entire dataset.

#### Model and Logs
- **resume_model.joblib**:  
  A serialized machine learning model file saved using the `joblib` library. This file can be loaded to make predictions without retraining the model.

- **ai_resume_bias.log**:  
  A log file that records the results of bias detection tests, errors, or other runtime information.

#### Visualization Files
- **probability_distribution_by_group.png**:  
  A visualization showing the probability distribution of predictions across different groups (e.g., gender, ethnicity).

- **probability_heatmap.png**:  
  A heatmap visualization representing bias metrics or prediction probabilities.

- **probability_bar_chart.png**:  
  A bar chart visualization summarizing bias-related metrics or prediction probabilities.

#### Bias Testing Results
- **bias_test_results.csv**:  
  A CSV file containing the results of bias tests, likely including metrics such as fairness scores or group-wise prediction probabilities.

### Purpose of the Files
- **Learning New Skills**:  
  The project involves advanced concepts like machine learning, bias detection, and data visualization. It could be created to learn skills such as model training, bias analysis, and visualization techniques.

- **Building a Project**:  
  The structured nature of the files suggests that this is a well-defined project aimed at solving a real-world problem, such as detecting bias in resume screening processes.
