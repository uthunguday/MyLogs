### Project Overview

The files listed suggest a **web application project** built using **React** with **TypeScript** and **Vite** as the build tool. The project appears to focus on **data visualization** and **UI component development**, leveraging **Tailwind CSS** for styling and possibly integrating reusable components for a design system. The presence of visualization-related files (e.g., `DataVisualizations.tsx`, `VisualizationCard.tsx`) and placeholder charts indicates that the project involves creating interactive visualizations, likely for analytics or reporting purposes.

This project is **not primarily for learning** but rather for **building a functional application** or a **design system**. Below is a breakdown of the relevant files:

### File Descriptions

#### Configuration Files
- **vite.config.ts**: Configuration file for Vite, specifying build settings, plugins, and optimizations for the project.
- **tsconfig.json**: TypeScript configuration file defining compiler options for the entire project.
- **tsconfig.node.json**: TypeScript configuration tailored for Node.js-specific code.
- **tsconfig.app.json**: TypeScript configuration for the application code, possibly separating concerns from Node.js or testing.
- **tailwind.config.ts**: Configuration file for Tailwind CSS, defining custom themes, colors, and utility classes.
- **postcss.config.js**: Configuration for PostCSS, used for processing CSS with plugins like Tailwind.

#### Core Application Files
- **main.tsx**: Entry point for the React application, rendering the root component.
- **App.tsx**: Main application component, likely containing the overall layout and routing logic.
- **App.css**: Global CSS file for the application, complementing Tailwind CSS.
- **index.html**: HTML template used by Vite to inject the React application.

#### Utility and Helper Files
- **dataUtils.ts**: Contains utility functions for processing or manipulating data, likely used for visualizations.
- **utils.ts**: General-purpose utility functions for the application.
- **use-toast.ts**: Custom React hook for managing toast notifications.
- **use-mobile.tsx**: Custom hook for detecting mobile devices or handling mobile-specific logic.

#### UI Components
- **DataVisualizations.tsx**: Component for rendering data visualizations, possibly integrating charts or graphs.
- **VisualizationCard.tsx**: A card component for displaying individual visualizations.
- **Summary.tsx**: Component for summarizing data or providing an overview.
- **Header.tsx**: Component for the application's header, likely containing navigation elements.
- **breadcrumb.tsx**, **calendar.tsx**, **button.tsx**, etc.: Reusable UI components for building a design system, such as navigation, forms, and interactive elements.

#### Placeholder and Visualization Files
- **placeholder_heatmap.html**, **placeholder_boxplot.html**, etc.: Placeholder files for testing or prototyping visualizations.
- **probability_heatmap.png**, **probability_distribution_by_group.png**: Images representing data visualizations, possibly used as references or static assets.

#### Documentation and Metadata
- **README.md**: Documentation file explaining the purpose, setup, and usage of the project.
- **robots.txt**: File for controlling web crawler behavior, indicating the project might be deployed online.
- **favicon.ico**: Icon displayed in the browser tab for the application.

#### Build and Dependency Files
