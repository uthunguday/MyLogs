### Project Overview

The files listed suggest a project focused on detecting and visualizing bias in AI models used for resume screening. The project likely involves training a machine learning model, testing it for bias, and visualizing the results. This project appears to be aimed at building a functional system rather than learning new skills, although it may involve skill development in areas like machine learning, bias detection, and data visualization.

### File Descriptions

#### **Python Files**
- **`visualize_bias.py`**  
  This script is likely responsible for generating visualizations (e.g., heatmaps, bar charts) to illustrate bias in the AI model's predictions. It may use libraries like Matplotlib or Seaborn for visualization.

- **`train_model.py`**  
  This script is used to train the machine learning model on the provided dataset (`training_dataset.csv`). It likely includes preprocessing steps, model training, and saving the trained model (`resume_model.joblib`).

- **`test_bias.py`**  
  This script tests the trained model for bias using the testing dataset (`testing_dataset.csv`). It may calculate metrics to evaluate bias and save the results in `bias_test_results.csv`.

- **`main.py`**  
  This is likely the entry point of the project, orchestrating the workflow of training, testing, and visualizing bias. It may call other scripts like `train_model.py`, `test_bias.py`, and `visualize_bias.py`.

#### **Data Files**
- **`UpdatedResumeDataSet.csv`**  
  A dataset containing updated resume data, possibly used for training or testing the model.

- **`training_dataset.csv`**  
  The dataset used for training the machine learning model.

- **`testing_dataset.csv`**  
  The dataset used for testing the model and evaluating bias.

- **`full_dataset_info.csv`**  
  Likely contains metadata or summary statistics about the entire dataset used in the project.

- **`resume_data.csv`**  
  Another dataset file, possibly used for preprocessing or additional analysis.

- **`bias_test_results.csv`**  
  Contains the results of bias testing, likely generated by `test_bias.py`.

#### **Model and Logs**
- **`resume_model.joblib`**  
  The trained machine learning model saved in Joblib format for reuse.

- **`ai_resume_bias.log`**  
  A log file containing runtime information, errors, or debugging details related to the project.

#### **Visualization Files**
- **`probability_heatmap.png`**  
  A heatmap visualization showing probabilities or bias distribution across different groups.

- **`probability_distribution_by_group.png`**  
  A visualization illustrating the probability distribution of predictions for different demographic groups.

- **`probability_bar_chart.png`**  
  A bar chart showing bias metrics or probabilities for different groups.

#### **Configuration and Documentation**
- **`requirements.txt`**  
  Lists the Python dependencies required to run the project, such as libraries for machine learning, data processing, and visualization.

- **`README.md`**  
  A documentation file explaining the purpose of the project, setup instructions, and usage details. It serves as a guide for users and developers.

### Project Purpose

This project is designed to **build a functional system** for detecting and visualizing bias in AI models used for resume screening. It involves:
- Training a machine learning model.
- Testing the model for bias.
- Visualizing bias metrics to ensure fairness in predictions.

The project is likely aimed at addressing ethical concerns in AI and improving transparency in automated decision-making systems.
