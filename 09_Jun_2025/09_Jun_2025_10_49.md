### Project Overview
The files listed suggest a **React-based web application** using **TypeScript** and **Vite** as the build tool. The project appears to focus on **data visualization**, **UI components**, and possibly **interactive dashboards**. It leverages **Tailwind CSS** for styling and includes a variety of reusable components for building a modern, responsive user interface. The presence of files like `resume_data.csv` and `probability_heatmap.png` indicates that the project might involve **data analysis or visualization** related to resumes or statistical probabilities.

This project is likely **building a product or tool**, rather than being purely educational, as it includes structured configurations, reusable components, and a focus on functionality.
