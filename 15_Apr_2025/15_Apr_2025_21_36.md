### File Descriptions

#### 1. **output_512x512.png**
   - **Description**: This is likely an output image file generated by the project. Based on the name, it could be a visualization of results, such as a heatmap, prediction visualization, or reconstructed image from a neural network.
   - **Purpose**: To display or analyze the results of the neural network's performance on the MNIST dataset.

#### 2. **mnist_reverse_nn.ipynb**
   - **Description**: This is a Jupyter Notebook file. Based on the name, it likely contains Python code and explanations for implementing a neural network (NN) that works with the MNIST dataset. The "reverse" in the name might indicate a specific variation or experiment, such as reversing the input or output process.
   - **Purpose**: To develop, train, and test a neural network on the MNIST dataset, possibly with a unique approach or architecture.

#### 3. **train-labels-idx1-ubyte.gz**
   - **Description**: This is a compressed file containing the labels for the training dataset of MNIST. Each label corresponds to the digit (0-9) in the training images.
   - **Purpose**: Used as ground truth for training the neural network.

#### 4. **train-images-idx3-ubyte.gz**
   - **Description**: This is a compressed file containing the training images of the MNIST dataset. These are 28x28 grayscale images of handwritten digits.
   - **Purpose**: Used as input data for training the neural network.

#### 5. **t10k-labels-idx1-ubyte.gz**
   - **Description**: This is a compressed file containing the labels for the test dataset of MNIST. Each label corresponds to the digit (0-9) in the test images.
   - **Purpose**: Used as ground truth for evaluating the neural network's performance.

#### 6. **t10k-images-idx3-ubyte.gz**
   - **Description**: This is a compressed file containing the test images of the MNIST dataset. These are 28x28 grayscale images of handwritten digits.
   - **Purpose**: Used as input data for testing the neural network.

#### 7. **mnist.zip**
   - **Description**: This is a compressed archive that likely contains the MNIST dataset files (e.g., training and testing images and labels).
   - **Purpose**: To provide the dataset in a downloadable format for use in the project.
