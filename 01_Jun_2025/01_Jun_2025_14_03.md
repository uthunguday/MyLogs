#### Project Context:
Without additional context, it is likely that this file belongs to a Python-based project. The project could range from a web application, a machine learning model, a script for automation, or any other Python-based solution. The specific purpose of the project would depend on the other files and the overall structure of the codebase.

#### Purpose:
- **Learning New Skills**: If this file is part of a tutorial, exercise, or educational project, it is likely created to help the user learn Python programming or a specific framework/library.
- **Building a Project**: If this file is part of a larger codebase with multiple modules, it is likely being used to build a functional application or tool.

#### Additional Notes:
To provide a more accurate description of the project, details about other related files or the content of `main.py` would be helpful.
