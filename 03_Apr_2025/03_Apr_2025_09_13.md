### File: `mnist_reverse_nn.ipynb`

#### Description:
This file is a Jupyter Notebook, as indicated by the `.ipynb` extension. Based on the name, it likely contains code and explanations for implementing a neural network (NN) that works with the MNIST dataset, but with a "reverse" approach. This could mean reversing the input-output relationship, exploring adversarial examples, or some other unconventional method of processing the MNIST dataset.

#### Project:
The project appears to be related to machine learning or deep learning, specifically focusing on the MNIST dataset. The MNIST dataset is a collection of handwritten digits commonly used for training and testing image classification models. This project might involve experimenting with neural networks to explore novel techniques or approaches.

#### Purpose:
- **Learning New Skills**: The file seems to be created for educational purposes, as working with MNIST and neural networks is a common way to learn about machine learning concepts.
- **Building a Project**: If the notebook includes a unique or innovative approach (e.g., "reverse" processing), it could also be part of a project aimed at showcasing or experimenting with advanced techniques.

#### Summary:
This file is likely part of a machine learning project or study, focusing on neural networks and the MNIST dataset, with an emphasis on exploring unconventional methods. It could serve both as a learning tool and as a foundation for a more advanced project. 
### Project Description:
 ### Consolidated Summary:
The code implements a pipeline for handling the MNIST dataset, including downloading, extracting, normalizing, and one-hot encoding the data. It defines a `NeuralNetwork` class with a feedforward architecture consisting of two hidden layers (Sigmoid activation) and an output layer (Softmax activation). The network supports forward propagation, backpropagation, parameter updates, and training using mini-batch gradient descent with cross-entropy loss. Additionally, the code includes functionality for reverse image generation by reconstructing input images from target probabilities using least squares. The generated images are verified by feeding them back into the network.

### Consolidated Code Statistics:
- **Total Lines of Code:** ~234
- **Number of Functions:** 10 (e.g., `forward`, `backward`, `update_params`, `train`, `generate_image_from_probs`)
- **Number of Classes:** 1 (`NeuralNetwork`)
- **Number of Layers in Network:** 4 (Input, 2 Hidden, Output)
- **Imports:** 10 libraries
- **Training Hyperparameters:** Epochs (15), Learning Rate (0.1), Batch Size (64)
- **Try-Except Blocks:** 4
- **Comments:** Extensive, explaining each step
