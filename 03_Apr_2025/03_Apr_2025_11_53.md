### File Descriptions

#### 1. **output_512x512.png**
   - **Description**: This file is likely an output image generated by the project. Based on the name, it could be a visualization of results, such as a heatmap, prediction visualization, or reconstructed image from a neural network.
   - **Purpose**: To display the results of the neural network's processing or predictions.
   - **Relevance**: Likely used to evaluate or demonstrate the performance of the model.

#### 2. **mnist_reverse_nn.ipynb**
   - **Description**: A Jupyter Notebook file that likely contains Python code, explanations, and visualizations for training and testing a neural network on the MNIST dataset. The "reverse" in the name suggests it might involve reversing the input-output relationship or performing some unique transformation on the MNIST dataset.
   - **Purpose**: To implement and experiment with a neural network model, possibly for educational purposes or research.
   - **Relevance**: Central to the project as it contains the main code and documentation for the neural network.

#### 3. **train-labels-idx1-ubyte.gz**
   - **Description**: A compressed file containing the labels for the training dataset of the MNIST dataset. Labels represent the digits (0-9) corresponding to the images.
   - **Purpose**: Used as ground truth for training the neural network.
   - **Relevance**: Essential for supervised learning tasks.

#### 4. **train-images-idx3-ubyte.gz**
   - **Description**: A compressed file containing the training images of the MNIST dataset. These are 28x28 grayscale images of handwritten digits.
   - **Purpose**: Used as input data for training the neural network.
   - **Relevance**: Essential for training the model.

#### 5. **t10k-labels-idx1-ubyte.gz**
   - **Description**: A compressed file containing the labels for the test dataset of the MNIST dataset.
   - **Purpose**: Used as ground truth for evaluating the neural network's performance on unseen data.
   - **Relevance**: Essential for testing and validation.

#### 6. **t10k-images-idx3-ubyte.gz**
   - **Description**: A compressed file containing the test images of the MNIST dataset.
   - **Purpose**: Used as input data for testing the neural network.
   - **Relevance**: Essential for testing the model.

#### 7. **mnist.zip**
   - **Description**: A compressed archive that likely contains the MNIST dataset files (images and labels for training and testing).
   - **Purpose**: To provide the dataset in a single downloadable file.
   - **Relevance**: Used to set up the project environment.
