### File Descriptions

#### 1. **mnist_reverse_nn.ipynb**
   - **Description**: This is a Jupyter Notebook file, likely containing Python code and explanations for implementing a neural network (NN) to work with the MNIST dataset. The "reverse" in the name suggests that the project might involve reversing the typical MNIST classification process, such as generating images from labels or performing some inverse operation.
   - **Purpose**: This file is central to the project and is used to develop and test the neural network model.
   - **Project**: The project appears to involve machine learning, specifically working with the MNIST dataset, which is a collection of handwritten digit images commonly used for training and testing image classification models.
   - **Learning or Building**: This file is likely created to **learn new skills** in machine learning and neural networks.

#### 2. **output_512x512.png**
   - **Description**: This is an image file, possibly generated as an output of the neural network model. The "512x512" in the name suggests that it is a resized or processed image, potentially visualizing results from the project.
   - **Purpose**: Used to visualize the output of the model, such as reconstructed or generated images.
