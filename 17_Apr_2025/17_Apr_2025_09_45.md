### File Descriptions

#### 1. **sentiment_model.pkl**
   - **Description**: This is a serialized machine learning model file, likely created using Python's `pickle` library. It contains a trained sentiment analysis model that can be loaded and used to predict the sentiment (positive, negative, or neutral) of customer reviews.
   - **Purpose**: Used to save and reuse the trained model without retraining it every time.
   - **Relevance**: Part of the project.

#### 2. **README.md**
   - **Description**: A markdown file that provides an overview of the project. It typically includes details such as the purpose of the project, how to set it up, how to use it, and any dependencies or requirements.
   - **Purpose**: Helps users and contributors understand the project and how to work with it.
   - **Relevance**: Essential for documenting the project.

#### 3. **LICENSE**
   - **Description**: A file that specifies the licensing terms for the project. It defines how others can use, modify, and distribute the code.
   - **Purpose**: Ensures legal clarity and protects the intellectual property of the project.
   - **Relevance**: Important for open-source or shared projects.

#### 4. **Customer_Product_Review.ipynb**
   - **Description**: A Jupyter Notebook file that likely contains the code for analyzing customer product reviews. It may include data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), model training, and evaluation steps.
   - **Purpose**: Serves as the main script for the sentiment analysis project.
   - **Relevance**: Core part of the project.

#### 5. **245_1.csv**
   - **Description**: A CSV file that likely contains the dataset used for the project. It may include customer reviews and their corresponding sentiment labels.
   - **Purpose**: Provides the data required for training and testing the sentiment analysis model.
   - **Relevance**: Essential for the project.

### Project Overview

- **Project Name**: Sentiment Analysis on Customer Product Reviews
- **Description**: This project focuses on analyzing customer reviews to determine their sentiment (positive, negative, or neutral). It involves data preprocessing, training a machine learning model, and saving the trained model for future use. The project likely uses Python libraries such as `pandas`, `scikit-learn`, and `pickle`.
- **Purpose**: The project is aimed at building a functional sentiment analysis tool, which could be used in real-world applications like customer feedback analysis or product improvement.

### Learning or Building?

- **Purpose**: This project appears to be **building a functional tool** rather than just learning a new skill. The presence of a trained model (`sentiment_model.pkl`), a dataset (`245_1.csv`), and a structured notebook (`Customer_Product_Review.ipynb`) suggests that the focus is on creating a working sentiment analysis system.

### Ignored Files
- **s5.PNG, s4.png, s3.PNG, s2.png, s1.png**: These are image files, likely used for visualizations or documentation purposes. They are not directly relevant to the code or functionality of the project. 
### Project Description:
 ### Consolidated Code Summary:
The code implements a sentiment analysis pipeline for product reviews. It processes text data using TF-IDF vectorization (word-level and character-level features), trains two machine learning models (LinearSVC and SGDClassifier), and evaluates their performance. The trained model is saved and used to predict sentiment for new user inputs. A basic UI, likely built with `ipywidgets`, allows user interaction by taking input, predicting sentiment, and displaying results.

### Consolidated Code Statistics:
- **Total Lines of Code**: 176 (143 + 33)
- **Number of Functions**: 2 (`wordcloud`, `on_predict_button_clicked`)
- **Number of Classes**: 0
- **Number of Imports**: 16
- **Number of Models Trained**: 2 (LinearSVC, SGDClassifier)
- **Number of Widgets Used**: 3 (`review_input`, `predict_button`, `output`)
