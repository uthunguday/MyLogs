### File Descriptions

#### 1. **sentiment_model.pkl**
   - **Description**: This is a serialized machine learning model file, likely created using Python's `pickle` library. It contains a trained sentiment analysis model that can predict the sentiment (e.g., positive, negative, neutral) of customer reviews.
   - **Purpose**: Used to save and load the trained model for reuse without retraining.
   - **Relevance**: Part of the project, as it stores the core functionality for sentiment analysis.

#### 2. **README.md**
   - **Description**: A markdown file that provides an overview of the project, including its purpose, setup instructions, usage, and any other relevant details.
   - **Purpose**: Helps users and contributors understand the project and how to use it.
   - **Relevance**: Essential for documenting the project.

#### 3. **LICENSE**
   - **Description**: A file that specifies the licensing terms under which the project can be used, modified, or distributed.
   - **Purpose**: Ensures legal clarity for users and contributors.
   - **Relevance**: Important for open-source or shared projects.

#### 4. **Customer_Product_Review.ipynb**
   - **Description**: A Jupyter Notebook file that likely contains code for analyzing customer product reviews. It may include data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), model training, and evaluation.
   - **Purpose**: Serves as the main script for implementing and testing the sentiment analysis workflow.
   - **Relevance**: Central to the project.

#### 5. **245_1.csv**
   - **Description**: A CSV file that likely contains customer product review data. It may include columns such as review text, ratings, and sentiment labels.
   - **Purpose**: Used as input data for training or testing the sentiment analysis model.
   - **Relevance**: Crucial for the project as it provides the dataset for analysis.

### Project Description

- **Project Name**: Sentiment Analysis on Customer Product Reviews
- **Purpose**: This project aims to analyze customer reviews of products to determine their sentiment (positive, negative, or neutral). It involves data preprocessing, training a machine learning model, and using the model to predict sentiment for new reviews.
- **Technologies**: Likely uses Python, Jupyter Notebook, and libraries such as `pandas`, `scikit-learn`, or `TensorFlow`.
- **Output**: A trained sentiment analysis model (`sentiment_model.pkl`) and insights from the analysis.

### Learning or Building?

- **Purpose**: This project appears to be a **learning project** aimed at developing skills in machine learning, natural language processing (NLP), and sentiment analysis. However, it could also serve as a prototype for a real-world application.

### Ignored Files
- **s5.PNG, s4.png, s3.PNG, s2.png, s1.png**: These are image files, likely used for visualization or documentation purposes, but they are not directly relevant to the code or functionality of the project. 
### Project Description:
 ### Code Summary:
The code implements a sentiment analysis pipeline for product reviews. It processes review data, maps ratings to sentiment categories, and uses TF-IDF vectorization for feature extraction. Two machine learning models, LinearSVC and SGDClassifier, are trained to classify sentiments. The code evaluates model performance and includes functionality to save/load models and vectorizers for future predictions.

### Code Statistics:
- **Lines of Code:** 123  
- **Number of Functions:** 1 (`wordcloud`)  
- **Number of Classes:** 0  
- **Number of Imports:** 15  
- **Number of Models Trained:** 2 (LinearSVC, SGDClassifier)
